AB  - This article proposes a re-reading of one of Philippe Descola's earliest works, La Selva Culta, Simbolismo y Praxis en la Ecologia de los Achuar. Despite Descola's focus on the relation between natural domains, consanguinity, affinity and marriage, this book's rich descriptions show the Achuar's understandings of non-human sociability. The book also gives insight into the mutually constitutive assemblies of which human plants and animals form part. In later work, Descola reinterprets the ethnography of La Selva Culta, now with a focus on the human/non-human relationship. I explore the openings and closures of these new interpretations, and see them in relation to the possibilities and blind zones that conceptual tools related to more-than-human approaches may offer. In the discussion of the latter, I draw on my own work on the Runa, and reflect on the implications for more-than-human approaches when, as Descola suggests, humanness exceeds the concept of 'the human'.

AB  - Philippe Descola is a self-confessed naturalist. Yet in his book Beyond Nature and Culture, he presents naturalism as just one of four possible ontologies that - for different peoples in different periods - have underwritten human thought and practice. The others are animism, totemism and analogism. In this article I explore some of the paradoxical consequences of his positing naturalism both as a frame for comparative analysis and as one of the terms enframed by it. These have to do with the logic of the ontological four-fold, the conversion of inference into schemas of tacit knowledge, the division between psychological and linguistic constructions of the self, alternative senses of interiority and physicality, the dichotomies between humanity as condition and as species, and between mind and nature, and the proper use of the concepts of production and transmission. I conclude by imagining what would happen if animism, rather than naturalism, were taken as a starting point for comparative understanding. Then life, growth and movement, rather than figuring as the exterior emanations of a world of being, would be restored to immanence in a world of becoming.Please see the response and rejoinder to this article:Biolatry: A Surrender of Understanding (Response to Ingold's A Naturalist Abroad in the Museum of Ontology) 10.1080/00664677.2016.1212523Rejoinder to Descola's Biolatry: A Surrender of Understanding 10.1080/00664677.2016.1212532

AB  - Philippe Descola's theory of different perceptions structuring the relations between humans and nonhumans and based on phylogenetic dispositions is moulded by the interplay of ontogenesis, collective practices, and prevailing value systems. He succeeds in processing the cartesian dichotomy between nature and culture in favor of alternative ontologies and abandoning the cultural view in favor of a uniform nature. His outcome is traced back to the most important anthropological, cognitive, and philosophical principles, and subsequent consequences and possibilities for anthropological studies are explored in response and anticipation of how humans and nonhumans including an organic entities may cohabit in the future.

AB  - Philippe Descola argues that human societies can be categorized by the ways in which they utilize broad assumptions about interiority and physicality, where interiority refers to something similar to what Edward Tylor and James Frazer meant by soul. In Descola's scheme, traditional Chinese culture, which gives play to infinite variability in both interiority and physicality, is strongly "analogist." In contrast, Descola defines modern, Western societies as "naturalist." We moderns see nature or physicality as universally fixed, but culture or interiority as variable. Contemporary China is rapidly modernizing and scientizing. In Descola's terms, its culture should be transitioning from an analogist one to a naturalist one. Through an examination of practices of memorialization and funerary ritual in urban China as well as Chinese Communist Party attempts to steer the evolution of these practices in reaction to "modernity," this essay attempts to tease out what is modern about the conceptions of soul implicit in contemporary Chinese dealings with death.

AB  - Philippe Descola's work on ontologies has created new possibilities for exploring the rich connections between creation myths and their ontological underpinnings. This has proven fruitful in studies of animist and totemist narratives whose myths often obsess with their respective ontological orientations. Analogist cosmogonies, however, remain more problematic. Descola argues that analogist ontologies are based upon a basic discontinuity between the diverse components of the cosmos. However, many analogist cosmogonic myths appear to depict a world based on continuity, kinship, and even monistic origins. While this discrepancy between ontological assumptions and cosmogonic myths may in some cases present a problem for Descola's model, it does not invariably do so. In this essay I argue that at least Greece's earliest cosmogonic myth, Hesiod'sTheogony, has little to do with a neatly unfolding harmony. Rather, Hesiod describes an inherently dangerous world composed of multiple and discrete elements in need of imposed order.

AB  - This article describes the cosmological and ontological assumptions of diviners in contemporary China with a view to contributing to current anthropological debates on ontology. Ethnographic examples demonstrate that divination based on the cosmology of the Yi Jing assumes a monist ontology characterized by continuity of physicality and interiority. This argument is supported by discussions of cosmogony and the separability of the person. The correlative character of Yi Jing cosmology assumes that resemblances between entities and phenomena are based on shared intrinsic characteristics rather than analogies. In relation to Philippe Descola's (2013) proposal of four modes of identification, this system posits continuity of physicality and interiority on a cosmic scale. It therefore constitutes a mode of identification-here labeled "Homologism," unaccounted for by this model-in which it logically displaces Totemism as the structural counterpoint to Analogism.

AB  - This article discusses how the legal systems in several Western countries, with a special focus on Italy, address our present day animal rights movement and how these legal systems can faithfully reflect the movement's values as well as promote them in a manner that will ultimately change the rights themselves and their cultural context: this is an extremely interesting issue for the semiotic study of the "humanization of animals". Therefore, I will summarize several semiotic arguments using the model of the four ontologies by Philippe Descola and the concept of prospectivism by Eduardo Viveiros De Castro. I expect several important changes will come about thanks to the ties between philosophical animal rights discourse and legal discourse and I also believe that the two most interesting issues will be animal labor and reproduction. I will concentrate on the debate over zoophilia laws in Denmark, Germany and Italy in order to propose a way to understand the threshold which separates humans and animals in our naturalistic ontology. Nowadays, "becoming animals" and "becoming humans" seem to be two central and open-ended semiotic processes: legal rights and animal rights philosophy help bring several issues into focus such as animal subjectivity and informed consent.

AB  - There is nothing universal in the nature/culture opposition in which anthropology originated, explains Philippe Descola in Par-dela nature et culture. Outside the West, this naturalist cosmology has never been relevant. While anthropology must aim at the universal, it must also ask whether it is not in fact time to free itself from this opposition, or, to put it in Descola's words, whether anthropology of culture should not in fact << develop and couple up with an anthropology of nature >>.

AB  - The hypotheses developed by Philippe Descola in Par-dela nature et culture are applied to texts from the Bible. By examining passages about the differences and similarities between people and animals, and trying to understand why the latter are included in the Covenant between God and Noah after the Flood, we notice less a rupture than a continuity between these two classes of beings. The same hierarchical principle applies to animals, to people, and to people and animals together. This principle can be connected with a theory of living beings and persons, which is typical of what Descola has called an "analogistic ontology".

AB  - What interest me in this paper is to explore the explanatory power of the concept "naturalism" used by the French philosopher and anthropologist Philippe Descola, by adapting it to the cinematographic analysis of Werner Herzog's work.
   This interdisciplinary experiment, melting cinematographic analysis, philosophy and history of art has, as main goal, to bring into light a thought transformed in images concerning the relationship of two strongly related concepts defining, according to Descola, our schemas of experience: otherness and owness
   Both concepts are linked together by the logic of complementarity, but also by a logic of exclusion. The first type of link is modified when the concept of 'otherness' appears not as alterity (alter) but as a radical otherness (aliud). To comprehend the other as a radical other is naturalism main feature.
   The alleged naturalism of Werner Herzog is part of a long tradition that has projected over the western concept of 'nature' that 'otherness' alien to culture.
   After an exposition of what is to be understood by the term 'naturalism' according to Descola, I will explore some images from Herzog's films in which I believe a clear instantiation of naturalism can be found, as an unwelcoming, radically other, nature.
   Finally, I will show that Herzog's naturalism is not fatal. A way out of it can be found through the way Herzog understands the role of the spectator.

AB  - is article examines the ecological vision of Jean-Marie Le Clezio as presented in his essay Hai (1971), inspired by a period living among the Indians of Panama. It explores the philosophical, poetic, and political dimensions of this vision and the manner in which it explodes the nature/culture divide, calling into question the Western anthropocentric concept of the human. Affinities are detected with the thought of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Gilles Deleuze. It examines two extracts from the author's fictional texts illustrating the themes of animal intelligence and of equality or partnership between human and non-human animals.

TI  - "Jesus Is the Same Arutam" Logics of Appropriation among Missionized Indians and Indigenized Missionaries
T2  - ANTHROPOS
LA  - English
KW  - GLOBALIZATION
AB  - This article challenges Claude Levi-Strauss' and Philippe Descola's diagnosis of the South American tropics, according to which the irreversible influences of the Western civilization have led to cultural homogenization and to the loss of autochthonous "originality." This author discloses local reactions to global impacts as appropriation processes and emphasizes the natives' agency. The missionary presence in the Ecuadorian Amazon has strongly influenced the native cosmology of the Achuar and Shuar, to which Descola particularly refers. However, Jesus has not replaced the indigenous spiritual power called Arutam. Rather the contemporary role and function of Jesus and Arutam exemplify the negotiation of cultural meanings. The article further analyzes the transcultural conditions of this appropriation and focuses on the inner logic of the indigenous and missionaries who create and define these new meanings. It demonstrates that the expression "Jesus is the same Arutam" does not necessarily illustrate the assimilation effects of cultural contact but rather the openness of cultural systems and the creative "originality" of the actors involved.

AB  - In 2000, a short scientific paper by Crutzen and Stoermer suggested the Holocene epoch had been supplanted by a new age, the anthropocene, in which human activities had come to rival the great forces of nature in shaping geological and earth system processes. Out of this, a new transdisciplinary research area has emerged, drawing together social and natural scientists, historians, philosophers, and artists, amongst others. In November 2015, as part of a parallel series of events associated with the COP21 United Nations climate change meetings in Paris, the College de France, under the auspices of anthropologist Philippe Descola, hosted a two-day conference, How to think the anthropocene? Anthropologists, philosophers, and sociologists facing climate change'. This article summarises some of the main presentations and ideas, including relational aspects between speakers.

AB  - In studies of ancient Greek divination, oracles are often claimed to pronounce ambiguous but true statements within an intricately ordered cosmos. There exist, however, several problematic exceptions. In Book 2 of the Iliad, Zeus deliberately deceives Agamemnon through a prophetic dream; Hesiod's Muses speak truths or lies depending on their mood; and Apollo's utterances can harm as easily as help. The possibility of divine deceit forces us to reconsider the ontological assumptions within which early Greek divination was understood to operate. Adopting Philippe Descola's concept of 'analogism', I argue that rather than a means of reading the cosmos, early Greek divination resembles more an act of diplomacy, an attempt to establish successful communication with supernatural beings within an always potentially fragmented world.

KW  - Amazonia
KW  - human-animal relations

AB  - Notions of animals as social subjects held by Amazonian Indians have played a central role in anthropology's ontological turn. Written as a reply to two critical responses to an earlier paper on human-animal relations, this essay explores the complex and often contradictory nature of ideas about animals and attitudes toward them held by both Amerindians and Euro-Americans. It suggests that, alongside mythology and shamanism, a further source of the Amerindians' ideas about animals as social subjects lies in their everyday interactions with animals, something they share in common with Welsh sheep farmers. This fits uneasily with Philippe Descola's contrast between animism and naturalism. The essay concludes by querying radical contrasts between "us" and "them." Such contrasts may have their heuristic, comparative, and rhetorical uses but tend to oversimplify complex ethnographic reality.

AB  - Building upon the anthropological categories developed by Philippe Descola, this article engages the crossing of the boundaries between humans and animals, while inquiring into the crossing of auxiliary ontological territories in fiction. The comparative reading of three novels by Pierre Bergounioux, Pierre Michon and Jean-Loup Trassard reveals a common appeal for hybridation, combining a dominant naturalist ontology with marginal animistic representations. This ontological decentering is first fulfilled through an arrangement of marginal practices and rituals, carried by off-beat characters searching to propitiate a wildlife they believe fundamental for their own existence. While this hybridation surely contributes to question the dualism arising from the separation between nature and culture, it remains possible to investigate the scope of such hybridation, either from the perspective of reception, or from the from the aesthetic motivations of the authors.

AB  - Political theorists have developed and refined the concept of culture through much critical discussion with anthropology. This article will deepen this engagement by claiming that political theory has glossed over a crucial aspect of the role of the concept of culture, rather than defined it incorrectly. It will be argued that culture represents one way of accounting for the variety of human groups by drawing on the recent 'ontological turn' in anthropology. This rests on an understanding of ontology as a system of classifying entities anterior to social relations rather than a philosophical position. The article will argue against culture's status as a neutral and universal method of understanding human diversity by situating it within a pluralist approach to ontology, that posits multiple ontological schemas which form different social systems, each with their own understanding of human difference. Through an investigation of the implicit ontological commitments of multiculturalism it will be claimed that all political positions rest on a set of ontological presuppositions, and that these classifications place restrictions on the politics that they can express. Thus, political theorists should be vigilant of implicit ontological biases, represented here by culture, if they are to positively accommodate human difference.

The aim is to demonstrate that metaphorical logic is abandoned, and the animal is recognized as an autonomous being that does not seek to represent or moralize as a fable. For this, we will use the notions of humanity condition, developed by Philippe Descola and that of cosmological subject, outlined by Eduardo Viveiros de Castro. The article is divided into four parts: the first is a brief introduction; the second corresponds to the critical reception of Ccoca; in the third we will expose the notions and, finally, in the fourth we will analyze the story. Finally, we conclude that the animal presence in "Los caballos" allow to question anthropocentrism and Cartesian discourse.

AB  - The project of ontological anthropology expounded by Philippe Descola has unexplored merits for a critical and secular anthropology of Christian conversion in indigenous societies. Drawing on Shuar descriptions of their healing practice in a context of medical pluralism in southeast Ecuador, this article argues that for animist peoples, Protestant Evangelicalism constitutes a step toward philosophical materialism or 'naturalism. While Shuar healing reserves a central place for hallucinogenic plant-induced visions for personal empowerment and shamanic healing, Shuar Evangelicals express a preference for engaging only the material qualities of medicinal plants. This is not, however, the consequence of adopting a disenchanted material cosmology but of a submissive mode of relating to the immaterial aspects of reality normally engaged in ancestral Shuar ontology. The article thereby extends the ontological turn's emphasis on what is known to a consideration of modes of relation to ontological content.

AB  - Understanding spirits among the Chukchi presents anthropologists with a perennial challenge. In the classic studies of Vladimir Bogoraz, one gets the impression that, for Chukchi, many spiritual entities have well-defined outlines and are given fixed names. More recently, Philippe Descola and Rane Willerslev have adopted the clear-cut distinctions that Bogoraz makes among various categories of spirits in formulating their respective grand theories. My experience in the field, on the contrary, has led me to conclude that, among Chukchi, the characteristics of spirits are not as nicely ordered as has been suggested in the works of these authors. In this contribution, I approach Chukchi understandings of spirits by comparing human-spirit relation to the relations of humans to the land and to the reindeer - relations which are inherently ambivalent. I argue that the way Chukchi construct their relationship to reindeer, to the land, and to spirits depends in large part on how reindeer, land, and spirits relate to the domestic hearth.

AB  - In this paper, within the framework of the emergence of the new realisms of the 21st century and their manifestation in Latin America, the New Analogical Realism of Mauricio Beuchot is addressed in particular. The Mexican philosopher understands that a large part of the philosophical developments of the 20th century have led to relativism, and that, given the socio-political consequences produced, it is necessary to compensate for realism. In this work, the possibility of compensating realism and avoiding relativism is problematized, starting from the same bases as those of the philosophies in question. Our objective is to review one of the ontological and epistemological assumptions that underlie said realism and evaluate its scope, while questioning its declared criticality. This analysis will allow us to sustain, based on the anthropological studies of Philippe Descola, that Beuchot's realism succumbs to the same relativism that he questions and, consequently, from this perspective, his proposal is insufficient to compensate realism and avoid relativism.

It suggests that the great divide between highlands and lowlands, far from simply being the translation of "natural facts", responds to specific analytical perspectives that mobilize privileged models (the idea of State, for example) whose semantic content is almost always extrinsic to the native cultural logic. Nevertheless, if we change the basic criterion from "social organization" to "cosmology", what had before been viewed as different by nature may find unusual continuities. In this regard, by reviewing some significant ethnographic references for the Andean case and discussing Philippe Descola's latest proposals, we take the concept of "multinaturalism", coined by Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, as an auspicious notion to express this continuity of cosmological character between the lowlands and highlands of South America.

AB  - The turn to ontology, often associated with the recent works of Philippe Descola, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, and Bruno Latour, but evident in many other places as well, is, in Elizabeth Povinelli's formulation, "symptomatic" and "diagnostic" of something. It is, I here argue, a response to the sense that sociocultural anthropology, founded in the footsteps of a broad humanist "linguistic" turn, a field that takes social construction as the special kind of human reality that frames its inquiries, is not fully capable of grappling with the kinds of problems that are confronting us in the so-called Anthropocene-an epoch in which human and nonhuman kinds and futures have become so increasingly entangled that ethical and political problems can no longer be treated as exclusively human problems. Attending to these issues requires new conceptual tools, something that a nonreductionistic, ethnographically inspired, ontological anthropology may be in a privileged position to provide.

AB  - This article aims to think afresh about the materiality of hydropower dams in Alpine valleys, an old-new energy hotspot expected to resume its central position on the renewable stage. It asks a simple question: does the energy transition agenda affect the materiality of infrastructures which remains ostensibly identical? To answer this question, we use Philippe Descola's distinction between materiality and physicality and apply it to a case study of the Sautet hydroelectric dam in the French Alps. Indeed, the European energy transition is partly based on the realization of a single liberalized market and the competitive renewal of dam concessions is a key step in this process. Yet, we argue that amidst these changes, the materiality of the studied dam remains substantially the same, while its physicality changes for strategic reasons. Local opposition to liberalization engages a re-evaluation of the physicality of dams (i.e., the way they are supposed to function) in three aspects: their role in river regulation; their territorial dimension; and their financial and fiscal mediating role. The study shows that hydroelectric materiality is a relational element, subject to interpretation between competing values and interests.

AB  - This article examines the role played by a nonhuman entity, the Atlantic Ocean, in institutional work. It uses the results of an in-depth case study concerning the local economy of a surfing-focused seaside town in the south-west of France, where relations with the ocean have been modified by institutional work facilitated by extreme coastal erosion during winter storms in 2013-2014. This work, performed by the actors of the local economy - which include the ocean - aims to change the institutions of surfing, and local planning in a coastal town, by acting to influence the relation between this local economy and the ocean. The study involves a qualitative analysis of 32 interviews with stakeholders in the local surfing industry to identify the role played by a nonhuman entity in deliberate action to influence institutions. Mobilization of the theoretical framework of the anthropologist Philippe Descola concerning the types of relations between humans and nonhumans leads to 1) the suggestion that the nonhuman agency of natural elements should be included in consideration of institutional work, and 2) a reconsideration of the relational influence of the material dimension in organization and management theory.

AB  - The article analyzes modern western projects to update anthropology. The projects are united by the idea of the end of human exclusiveness, which is a modern form of the concept of human death. According to idea of the end of human exclusiveness, a person has no ontological privileges in the world, and he must be thought of as a part in the totality of other parts of the whole - nature, space, objects, etc. It is possible to allocate four forms of the realization of this idea: overcoming the oppositions "nature-culture", "man-animal", "man- technician", and "man-objects". In the article the first form of this idea, projects of anthropology beyond nature and culture, is analyzed. Within the framework of these projects, two tendencies are observed - naturalization of man and anthropomorphization of the world. Both directions are investigated on the example of works, on the one hand, of Jean-Marie Schaeffer, on the other, Philippe Descola and Ernesto B. Viveiros de Castro. Schaeffer's anthropology becomes anti-anthropology the moment he starts speaking of man in the language of evolutionary biology. Man fits them into an evolutionary process, within which the cause of a person's actions appears beyond him. The anthropomorphization of the world is based on ethnographic data on the so-called "primitive peoples". If naturalism concerns the reduction of the anthropological to the biological, then here it is possible to speak of an intellectual forgery. Descola and de Castro identify the ideas of weak philosophy on the bases where the life of the mystery community is constructed. In this case, the mystery is described in social categories, and the exotic content of representations of the studied peoples serves as an argument for the chaotization of our own ideas. The author of the article believes that modern anti-anthropologists are trying to interpret the truly human, contained in mysteries, in terms of the inhuman.

AB  - For the conceptions of animism developed in the contemporary anthropology technological changes taking place in the indigenous collectives that consist of both human and non-human essences seem to be a blind spot. Anthropologists don't notice any consequences of their visits and are tending to idealize the societies they study as "cold societies" (Claude Levi-Strauss). If the technologies are entering the indigenous worlds they are easily absorbed by the traditional cosmologies. This article analyzes some of the theoretical models of the ontological turn in anthropology in order to understand its capacity to explain an indigenous collective in which the irreversible technological changes are taking place. By taking as a starting point a discussion between Philippe Descola and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro are defined the personalist conceptions of animism in which the communication with non humans beings and essences are built around a basic ontological premise about the existence of person and identity. In this kind of personalist models the collectives are considered as hermetic worlds in which the technologies cannot penetrate and even if they did, they left unnoticed (neither by indigenes nor by anthropologists). This anthropological blindness cannot be eliminated neither by application Descola's concept of multiplicity of tabulations, nor by Viveiros de Castro's principle of double twist.
   The attempt to correct the supposed rigidity of these theoretical models was made by Morten Axel Pedersen and Eduardo Kohn. Although, despite the assumption of existence of unstable identities and variable ontological status of beings and essences they don't reject the ontological personalism. The conceptual solution is supposed to be found in the relationalist ontologies of Nurit Bird-David and Elizabeth Povinelli that accentuate the changing relations between actors instead of the concept of person. Those flexible and situational variations can abolish the principle person and identity by changing the relations with the non-human beings. In this sense, they could be more sensible to the (post) colonial technological changes in the indigenous collectives.

AB  - The socio-anthropological research that aims to rehabilitate the idea of animal agency relies on a core of recurring arguments: that until recently, the social sciences have wrongly classified animals amongst things, because they subscribed either to the animal-machine model imposed by modernity across the frontier that it sought to draw between nature and culture (Philippe Descola) or between humans and non-humans (Bruno Latour), and animals in particular (Animal Studies). The purpose of this article is to show, first, that this thesis is historically inaccurate. From the birth of the social sciences they recognized that many animals had considerable subjectivity and established their continuity with man. And far from being the result of a feature of modernity and its discourse that of science the success of the theme of the frontier between nature and culture is, on the contrary, the result of a clear rejection of the hard sciences, and particularly biology, by the social sciences of the twentieth century. This return to the past thus helps to show that these recent rehabilitations of animal agency in fact revive another frontier between the social sciences and the life sciences and thus maintain the old philosophical dualisms associated with it. In so doing, they help close a path that promises to be particularly fruitful for documenting animal agency: a dialogue without reciprocal reduction between the social sciences and the life sciences.

AB  - This article develops a comparative and recursive approach to political ontology by drawing on the ontological turn in anthropology. It claims that if ontological commitments define reality, then the use of ontology by recent pluralist political theorists must undercut pluralism. By charting contemporary anthropology's rereading of structuralism as part of a plural understanding of ontology, it will be shown that any political ontology places limits on the political, and thus cannot exhaust political experience. This position will be established through an analysis of the role of Claude Levi-Strauss in the work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe and a comparison with the political ontology represented by perspectivism and potential affinity. Anthropology's lesson for political theory is that ontology cannot simply be revised and treated in the singular, but that political ontologies must be analysed comparatively to reveal the shortcomings of, and recursively alter, one's own political frame of reference.

AB  - In a wide range of contemporary debates on Japanese cultures of technological practice, brief reference is often made to distinct Shinto legacies, as forming an animist substratum of indigenous spiritual beliefs and cosmological imaginations. Japan has been described as a land of Shinto-infused 'techno-animism': exhibiting a 'polymorphous perversity' that resolutely ignores boundaries between human, animal, spiritual and mechanical beings. In this article, we deploy instances of Japanese techno-animism as sites of theoretical experimentation on what Bruno Latour calls a symmetrical anthropology of nature-cultures. In staging a dialogue between actor-network theory and Japanese techno-animism, we show how Shinto cosmograms provide an enlivening and alternative diffraction device on several of the ontological motifs manifested in Latour's work. In particular, by mobilizing the territory of a 'new' animism debate in anthropology - manifested in the work of Philippe Descola and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro - we attempt to infuse Latourian 'multinaturalism' with new, other-than-western analytical energy. Extending actor-network theory, we argue, Shinto cosmograms offer an interesting vantage point for interpreting the immanent, affective, enchanting and enabling powers of non-humans in contributing to collective life. By thus broadening the 'cosmopolitical' imagination beyond Latour's own European-Catholic frame of reference, Shinto techno-animism offers up a wider reflection on contemporary entanglements of science, politics, ecology and cosmos. This reflection, we conclude, opens up a new intellectual territory, allowing us to trace techno-animist streams of thinking both 'East' and 'West', beyond the confines of the scientific naturalism indigenous to European thinking.

AB  - In conversation with Peter Skafish Brazilian anthropologist, philosopher, and political activist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro offers an overview of his thinking, both past and present. After explaining why initially he argued that ontology should be a topic of anthropologists, he discusses his more recent conclusion that indigenous thought should be regarded instead as metaphysical. It is not that La pensee sauvage has an implicit ontology discoverable by the human sciences but, rather, that indigenous people themselves think about metaphysical issues as such.
   De Castro traces the origins of his position in the ethnographic fieldwork that he undertook in the 1980s with the Arawete of northwestern Brazil and in his and the anthropologist Philippe Descola's parallel engagements with the structuralism of Claude Levi-Strauss. De Castro points out the definitive post-structuralist period in Levi-Strauss' thought after the first volume of Mythologies when the notion of structure lost its pertinence to give place to the concept of transformation. Although he is usually considered, especially in Anglo-American anthropological community, as a thinker of binary oppositions, Levi-Strauss' ultimate goal is to demonstrate the ethnographic phenomena that cannot be placed in the dualist frames such as famous nature and culture distinction. Finally, Viveiros de Castro addresses the political stakes of ascribing metaphysics to non-modern peoples, clarifying what he means by the "permanent decolonization of thought." Following the suggestion made by French philosopher Patrice Maniglier, he claims that anthropology as a comparative discipline by definition should play the role of model science that had been ascribed to physics from the outset of modernity until today.

AB  - This paper argues that the conditions of the Anthropocene render the four ontologies described by Philippe Descola obsolete, and begins the search for a fifth ontology that speaks to the meaning of the arrival of the new epoch. The radically new dispensation destabilises all prior understandings of the human, of nature and of the relationship between the two. Before progress is possible, the Anthropocene must be correctly understood. The concept emerged in the year 2000notas another term to describe the extent of human impact across the landscape, the environment or ecosystems, but as a new idea to capture avery recentchange in the nature of human impact on the Earth as a total entity, activity of a kind and on a scale sufficient to shift the geological evolution of the planet itself. The emergence of humans as a force of nature represents arupturein human history and in Earth history, and a shift in the ontological status of both humankind and the Earth. All previous ontological systems are Holocene ones. The Earth can no longer be characterised, as it has been in environmental philosophy and post-humanism, as passive and fragile, as our victim; it is increasingly marked by angry, violent and uncontrollable behaviour, all of which destroys the conceit of human mastery. However, this emphatically does not mean that humans are powerless and that our agency can be reduced to the "agencies" of other creatures. A new ontology must grasp the primal Anthropocene fact that humankind is so powerful and so exceptional that it can knowingly change the geological trajectory of the Earth. The essence of the Anthropocene is not technological but lies in the fact that technological humans have shifted the Earth into a "no analogue state." A fifth ontology might begin from the reconfiguration of time implied when humans became a geological force, and as a result the novel way we must look into the future and reconsider the nature of the being of humans. If an ontology is the expression of the emotional orientation of the times, then the grounds of a fifth ontology can be found in the "attunement" of the millions of striking school students. The essential disposition appears to be that of dread.

AB  - The paper addresses ritual and quotidian aspects of bathing in thermal springs at Bakreswar, a Hindu pilgrimage site in India. Ascetics, priests, pilgrims, and scientists vouch for the mineral content and healing properties of the spring waters. Drawing on ethnographic field research, the paper identifies three broad trajectories of responses to the origin and importance of the springs in ways that align the local landscape with the grand scale of cosmogony: that of Vedic priests, Tantric ascetics, and scientists from the Department of Atomic Energy. In so doing it explores how different meanings of nature are configured across contrasting registers of religion, magic, and science, which reinforce their confrontation in the locale as an operational, everyday discourse.

FX  - This research was initiated while I was on a postdoctoral fellowship at the Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Sociale, Paris, and given final shape when I was at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity, Gottingen. For this, I should like to express my foremost gratitude to Philippe Descola and Peter van der Veer for their constant encouragement, support, and graciousness. I must also thank the staff of MPI-MMG, Gottingen, for maintaining congenial working conditions, which greatly facilitated the writing of this research. I owe a special word of thanks to Deborah Durham and Andrew Kipnis for reading the manuscript and offering meticulous editorial guidance while seeing it through publication.

AB  - The pursuit of world peace has long been part of the telos of modern anthropology, although this may not be particularly obvious in the discipline's teaching on its history today. Taking Claude Levi-Strauss's essay on Jean-Jacques Rousseau as a key text, this article reviews how anthropology rose to prominence (post-World War II) as a vital body of knowledge in the making of a durable international peace.

FX  - I thank the organizers of the 2019 Levi-Strauss Memorial Lecture for their warm reception and for the opportunity to rethink Levi-Strauss's early work. I owe my interest in Rousseau to conversation with Keith Hart and my interest in Metraux to Eduardo Krebs. I thank them both, and also Philippe Descola, Caroline Humphrey, and Gregory Delaplace for their encouragement. Special thanks are also due to Soo Choi of UNESCO, as well as Kyung-Koo Han, Robert Storrie, and Tony Crook who commented on the essay's early versions. The reference to Cold War history benefited from an international research project on Cold War conceptual history generously supported by the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2016-LAB-2250005).
